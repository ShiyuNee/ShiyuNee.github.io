I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.cas.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jiafeng Guo](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/gjf/) and Prof. [Keping Bi](https://kepingbi.github.io/). I am a member of [CAS Key Lab of Web Data Science and Technology](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/) and [TIME Group](https://stay-hungry-time.github.io/). My research interests lie in the general area of Information Retrieval (IR) and NLP, with a special focus on Hallucination Detection, LLMs' Knowledge Boundaries, and Adaptive RAG. If you are interested in any form of collaboration, feel free to contact me. Email: nishiyu23z@ict.ac.cn.
